Whether you are a talented athlete looking for a full-ride scholarship to your dream college or you are more of a club sport athlete looking to play at a more recreational level, there are scholarships for both types, and everyone in-between. Based on your sport, there may be more or less competition which will affect the amount of scholarship money and awards that can be disbursed. For high-visibility sports such as football or basketball, it may be harder to break into a program and land a full-ride scholarship. Even though college and universities are the most sought-out for athletic scholarships, there are organizations and businesses that reward student-athletes. Know your skill, worth, and do your research when looking into possible athletic scholarships
